<!-- ADD NEW ELEMENTS HERE -->
<!-- Created a new smaller heading, and called it "Brainstorms" -->
<h2>Brainstorms</h2>

<!-- Created a new paragraph below heading 2, with our web app idea -->
<p class="info" id="web-app-idea">
Our idea for a web app is one that syncs with your refrigerator
and keeps track of the food inside, and will order common ingredients if
they run out. This is not even remotely feasible or useful, but it looks
like a paragraph just the same.
